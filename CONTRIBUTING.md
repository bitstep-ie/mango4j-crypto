## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making 
participating in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of program, 
level of experience and title

### Our Standards
Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a _positive_ environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the enterprise
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of _unacceptable_ behaviour by participants include:
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibility
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this code of conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within the project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include an official project email address, discussing topic in Microsoft Teams or Flowdock, attending meetings or presenting content as part of a Tech Talk or Brown Bag. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement
Instances or abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting a member of the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
